Shinobi is the Open Source CCTV platform written in Node.JS. Designed with multiple account system, Streams by WebSocket, and Save to WebM. Shinobi can record IP Cameras and Local Cameras.

Shinobi is not made by the current or previous ZoneMinder developers. This app is inspired by ZoneMinder and all it's glory.
